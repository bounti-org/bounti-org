==========

_What can't we do if we all work together?_

Bounti is intended to be an online environment where people can come together and organize 
themselves around common purposes. It is partly a discussion environment, and partly an
organically-growing tree of Kickstarter-like projects.

The backbone of Bounti is a tree of Purposes. For example, the top-level Purpose might be 
"make the world a better place", which might eventually drill down to "stop fracking".
But the Bounti Purpose tree might also drill down to "eliminate barriers to fracking".
The intent is to foster reasoned discourse, find points of agreement, and then split
the tree at legitimate points of disagreement.

Purposes are drafted, discussed, improved, and organized.
Circles form to achieve Purposes by carrying out Projects.
Each Circle and Project can gain Backers (think continuous KickStarter).

Simplicity is king: except for long-form articles, every communication has a length limit
and every entity has a complexity budget.

Everything except financial transactions is free. Those are gently taxed.

All information and all supporting software is open.

Information Model
-----------------

* Purposes: management, discovery, discussion, and reputation for goals that might be pursued

* Backers: people who support Circles by providing resources
* Projects: carried out by Circles
* Actions: steps in Projects

Main Ingredients
----------------

* [Holacracy](http://holacracy.org/) provides the guiding organizational principles, 
  although the user experience carefully hides detail until it is necessary.
* People are identified by their LinkedIn profiles, to keep it real, serious, 
  and safe enough to handle significant resources.

Technology
----------
* Play
* Scala
* backbone and underscore
* jquery
* AWS
