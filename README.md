==========

_Together, we can do anything._

Purposes are drafted, discussed, improved, and organized.
Circles form to achieve Purposes by carrying out Projects.
Each Circle and Project can gain Backers (think continuous KickStarter).

Simplicity is king: except for long-form articles, every communication has a length limit
and every entity has a complexity budget.

Everything except financial transactions is free. Those are gently taxed.

All information and all supporting software is open.
